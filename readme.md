*Welcome to my first homework project!*
Index.html:

I began this assignment by identifying all the html elements that could be updated to fit with semantic html, I made sure to check the status of the page after each element change to ensure the code was still functioning as intended. After updating the elements, I added descriptive "alt tags" to provide greater accessibility on the page. The last changes I made to the html was update the element classes to be less redundant on the style.css file.

Style.css:

I began on this page by identifying all the redundant selectors and properties and combining them as I was able, using the updated classes I gave to them, this drastically reduced the number of lines of code being used. I then reordered the code to be in logical order in accordance to the index.html file. After refactoring the code the file size was reduced from 200 lines of code to 125 lines of code.

Reademe.md:
Which brings us to this page, I used this page to detail the changes I made and justify the reasoning.
